## Questions

1. What is Redux?

```
Redux is an independant library with multi framework compatability.
```

2. What packages do we install to use Redux?

```
To use redux you first npm install redux and react-redux
```

3. In your own words, describe the flow of how Redux is used to manage state.

```
Redux uses its own "Store" to store and handle changes in state to then pass it down as props.
```

4. What do we use in order to manage different pieces of state?

```
We use reducers to make & manage different pieces of state.
```

5. What do we use to perform an update to state?

```
We use actions to perform an update to state and types to define the action we are performing.
```

6. How do we access state from Redux?

```
We use the react redux connect() feature to connect the react redux store to our components.
```

7. In your own words, describe how to set up Redux for a React App.

```
To set up Redux for a React App you first npm install react-redux and redux. You then create a store dirctory (this is redux' independant "storage") for our actions, types, and reducers. Finally add an index.js file to the store and import and use the createStore feature from redux.
```
